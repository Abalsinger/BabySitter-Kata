## Design Process and Development Notes

* After reading the requirements what stuck me was that bedtime was not specified and therefore could be any arbitrary time before midnight.
* With that in consideration I decided to make this project into an application similar to a loan calculator, where the user can enter whatever numbers they needed to calculate based on that night's situation.
* I went through my local and github React projects that I had built as part of some learning exercises.
* After finding a loan calculator among my projects - I used it as a blueprint to design the component and function structure of this application.
